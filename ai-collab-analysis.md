## Collaboration Overview

Throughout this project, I collaborated with ChatGPT in an iterative, design-focused workflow. I provided clear objectives—such as building responsive layouts, refining flat-design elements, fixing spacing issues, improving mobile behavior, and adding gradients—and ChatGPT generated complete code files, revisions, and explanations to support each step.

My prompting strategy was highly incremental and task-oriented. I requested specific components (headers, hero sections, uniform boxes, gradients, menus), then refined them using screenshots and follow-up instructions. This created a continuous feedback loop that helped me adjust both design and functionality quickly.

I routinely used prompts to:

- request full-file replacements

- troubleshoot CSS and layout issues

- correct responsive behavior

- update buttons, navigation, and animations

- enhance visual consistency across the site

Overall, my approach emphasized precision, responsiveness, and iterative refinement, enabling smooth collaboration and accurate code improvements.

How I Can Improve My Prompting Strategy

To make future collaborations even more efficient, I can strengthen my prompting strategy in several ways:

1. Provide Context at the Start of Each Request

Specifying which file, section, or device view I’m referencing helps avoid accidental overwrites or misaligned changes.

2. Group Related Tasks Together

Instead of multiple sequential requests (e.g., spacing, colors, buttons), grouping them into a single prompt leads to cleaner and more unified code updates.

3. Paste the Current File When Reporting Issues

Because my local version may differ from previous responses, sharing the exact file ensures accurate debugging.

4. Mention Screen Size When Reporting Responsive Bugs

Responsive problems often vary by viewport, so identifying the device width (e.g., “430px mobile view”) leads to more precise fixes.

5. Ask for Explanations When Needed

Requesting quick explanations of CSS or layout behavior helps prevent repeated issues and strengthens my understanding.

By improving these areas, I can make the collaboration faster, clearer, and more streamlined—while also increasing the quality and consistency of the final work.
